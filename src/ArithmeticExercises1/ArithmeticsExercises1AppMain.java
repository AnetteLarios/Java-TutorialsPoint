This is a simple program example of how to use arithmetic operators in Java.
The program has a model called 'BudgetEmployee' that contains four attributes: salaryJanuary,
salaryFebruary, taxJanuary, and TaxFebruary. With these attributes the program is going to make different
arithmetic operations.
